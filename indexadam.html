    <h2>History Amsterdam</h2>
    <p>
        Amsterdam has a long and eventful history. The origins of the city lie in the 12th century, 
        when fishermen living along the banks of the River Amstel built a bridge across the waterway near the IJ, 
        which at the time was a large saltwater inlet. 
        Wooden locks under the bridge served as a dam protecting the village from the rising IJ waters, 
        which often flooded the early settlement. The mouth of the river Amstel, where the Damrak is now, 
        formed a natural harbor, which became important for trading-exchange from the larger koggeships into the smaller 
        ships that sailed the merchandise deeper into the hinterland.</p>

    <p>
        The oldest document referring to the settlement of "Aemstelredamme" (Amsterdam) 'dam in the river Amstel' 
        comes from a document dated 27 October 1275 CE. Inhabitants of the village were, by this document, 
        exempted from paying a bridge toll in the County of Holland by Count Floris V.</p>

    <p>
        Excavations between 2005 and 2012 found evidence that the origins of Amsterdam are much older than 'only' the twelfth century. 
        During the construction of the Metro "Noord-Zuid lijn" archaeologists discovered, some 30 meters below street level, pole-axes, 
        a stone hammer, and some pottery, all dating from the Neolithic era (New Stone Age). 
        This would mean Amsterdam, or its predecessor would have seen human habitation since about 2600 BCE.

    <h2>20th Amsterdam</h2>
    <p>
        During World War I, the Netherlands remained neutral, but Amsterdam suffered the effects of the war when food became scarce. 
        When working-class women started to plunder a ship with army supplies, the military was brought in. 
        Workers joined their wives in the plundering and the soldiers opened fire on them. 
        Six people were killed and almost 100 were wounded.

        During the interwar period, the city continued to expand, 
        most notably to the west of the Jordaan district in the Frederik Hendrikbuurt and surrounding neighbourhoods.
        
        In 1932, a dike separating the Zuider Zee from the North Sea, the Afsluitdijk, was completed. 
        The Zuider Zee was no more. The new lake behind the dyke was called IJsselmeer. For the first time in its history, 
        Amsterdam had no open communication with the sea.</p>

    <p>
        During World War II, German troops occupied the city. More than 100,000 Jews were deported, 
        famously including Anne Frank, almost completely wiping out the Jewish community. 
        Before the war, Amsterdam was the world's center for the diamond trade. 
        Since this trade was mostly in the hands of Jewish businessmen and craftsmen, the diamond trade essentially disappeared.

        Amsterdam made a bid for the 1952 Olympic Games (summer games) but was unsuccessful. The games went to Helsinki.
        During the 1970s, the number of foreign immigrants, primarily from Suriname, Turkey, and Morocco, grew strongly. 
        This increase led to an exodus of people to the 'growth cities' of Purmerend, Almere and other cities near Amsterdam. 
        However, neighbourhoods like the Pijp and the Jordaan, which had previously been working class, 
        became sought out places of residence for the newly wealthy yuppies and students. 
        Amsterdam that used to be a poor city in the Netherlands turned into an economically rich city thanks to the new economical trend 
        towards a service-economy instead of an industrial economy. </p>

    <p>
        In 1992, an El Al cargo plane crashed in the Bijlmermeer in Amsterdam Zuidoost. 
        This disaster, called the Bijlmerramp, caused the death of at least 43 people.
        At the beginning of the millennium, social problems such as safety, ethnic discrimination, 
        and segregation between religious and social groups began to develop. 45% of the population of Amsterdam has non-Dutch parents. 
        Large social groups are people from Surinam, the Dutch Antilles, Morocco and Turkey. 
        Amsterdam is characterized by its (perceived) social tolerance and diversity. 
        The social tolerance was endangered by the murder of Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh on 2 November 2004 by a Mohamed Bouyeri, 
        an Islamic fundamentalist. The mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, and his alderman for integration Ahmed Aboutaleb 
        formulated a policy of "keeping things together" which involves social dialogue, 
        tolerance and harsh measures against those who break the law.

    <h2>21th Amsterdam</h2>
    <p>
        In the early years of the twenty-first century, 
        the Amsterdam city center successfully attracted large numbers of tourists by means of campaigns such as I Amsterdam. 
        Between 2012 and 2015, 3000 hotel rooms were built, Airbnb added another 11.000 accommodations and the annual number 
        of visitors rose from 10 million to 17 million. Real estate prices have surged, 
        making the center unaffordable for the city's inhabitants, while local shops are making way for tourist-oriented ones.
        These developments have evoked comparisons with Venice, a city already overwhelmed by the tourist influx.
        </p>

    <p>
        Construction of a metro line connecting the part of the city north of the IJ to the center was started in 2003. 
        The project is controversial because its cost exceeded its budget by a factor three by 2008,
        because of fears for damage to buildings in the center, and because construction had to be halted and restarted multiple times.
       </p>
       
    <p>
        Since 2014, renewed focus has been given to urban regeneration and renewal, 
        especially to areas directly bordering the city center such as Frederik Hendrikbuurt. 
        This urban renewal and expansion of the traditional center of the city is part of the Structural Vision Amsterdam 2040 initiative.
